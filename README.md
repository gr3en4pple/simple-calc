This project is creating a simple calculator that i have made at sometime in May or June 2021

As everyone else on the beginning of Javascript learning, i was recommended to create this simple calculator.
This project gave me knowledge about using flex-box and the javascript also.

Until now, i decide to open it again to fix some layouts and push it on github page at: https://gr3en4pple.github.io/simple-calc
